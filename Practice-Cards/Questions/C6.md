- Why is the PID more important than the process name?
- Start the Metasploit exploitation framework
- Filter processes by name to find a specific process (e.g., `msfconsole`)
- Understanding filtered process output

- Understanding nice values and process priority
- Start the process `/bin/slowprocess` with higher priority
- Start the process `/bin/slowprocess` with lower priority
- Change the priority of a running process with PID `6996` to a nice value of `20`
- Change the priority of a running process using the `top` utility

- Kill signals reference table
  - **SIGHUP** 
  - **SIGINT**

- Restart a process with PID `6996`.
- Forcefully Terminate a process with PID `6996`
- Default kill (SIGTERM) a process with PID `6996`.
- Kill a process by name `zombieprocess` instead of PID
- Kill a process from within `top`
- Open a file named `newscript` in `l3afpad` in background
- Move a process with PID `1234` to the foreground
- Schedule the script `/root/myscanningscript` to run at 7:20 AM today using the `at` command
- Schedule the script `/root/myscanningscript` to run using various `at` time formats
  - **Time Formats:**
    - `at 7:20pm`
    - `at 7:20pm June 25` 
    - `at noon` 
    - `at noon June 25` 
    - `at tomorrow`
    - `at now + 20 minutes` 
    - `at now + 10 hours` 
    - `at now + 5 days` 
    - `at now + 3 weeks` 
    - `at 7:20pm 06/25/2019` 
  - All formats schedule a **one-time** job for future execution via the `at` daemon.
- Understand `at` vs `crond`
