- Create a file `/tmp/kalifile`
- Grant ownership of `/tmp/kalifile` to `kali`

- Check the permissions of `/usr/share/hashcat` 
  - What indicates

  - What does each column mean?
    ```bash

        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 240526 Apr 24  2024 hashcat.hcstat2
        lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     25 Apr 24  2024 modules -> ../../lib/hashcat/modules

- Combination to allocate all permissions to all (owner, group, user)
- Allocate all permissions to `/usr/share/hashcat/hashcat.hcstat2`

- _**Note:** Second Approach approach_
- Indicators for
  - User
  - Group

- Indicators for
  - Adding a permission
  - Setting a permission
  - Removing a permission
- Remove the `write` permission from user for file `/usr/share/hashcat/hashcat.hcstat2`
- Give `execute` permission to both the owner and group for file `/usr/share/hashcat/hashcat.hcstat2`
- Reset back to the default permission `rw-r--r--` of `/usr/share/hashcat/hashcat.hcstat2`
- Provide the following permissions to the new tool named `newhackertool`

- How to change file permission using `unmask`?
- Is `unmask` value universal to all the users?
