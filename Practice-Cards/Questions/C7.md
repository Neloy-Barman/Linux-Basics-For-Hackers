- Differentiate between Environment Variables and Shell Variables
- What is the name of the environment in Kali Linux?
- Describe the syntax structure used for defining variables
- What are the main reasons for modifying default environment variables in a Linux hacking system?
- View all default environment variables on the system
- What is the naming convention for environment variables?
- Overview of the following variables 
  - **TERM** 
  - **SHELL** 
  - **USER** 
  - **PATH** 
  - **HOME** 
- View all environment variables, including shell variables, local variables, and shell functions
- View environment variables line by line and the interactive buttons
- Filter for a specific variable (e.g., `HISTSIZE`) within the environment list
- What does `HISTSIZE` define and what is the default value
- Change the value of `HISTSIZE` to disable command history storage for the current session
  - **Result**
  - **Effect** 
  - **Purpose** 
- Which command is used to share the current shell's HISTSIZE variable with child processes and sub-sessions?
- Save the current value of the `HISTSIZE` variable to a text file named `valueofHISTSIZE.txt` in the home directory
- Save the output of all current environment settings to a text file named `valueofALLon01012017.txt` in the home directory
- How do you update the HISTSIZE variable to 1000 and ensure it is available as an environment variable for child processes and sub-shells?
- Which command is used to display the path of the current shell environment you are using?
- How do you update the HISTSIZE variable to 1000 and ensure it is available as an environment variable for child processes and sub-shells?
- Which command is used to display the path of the current shell environment you are using?
- Persistently disable command history by modifying the configuration file, and make the changes permanent.
- Reset the `HISTSIZE` variable to the value `1000` and make it permanent across all environments
- What does `PS1` variable do?
- What do the following placeholders represent when used in the `PS1` variable?
  - **\u** 
  - **\h** 
  - **\w** 
- Set the shell prompt variable to the string `"World's Best Hacker: #"` and make it permanent across sessions
- Configure the shell prompt to mimic a Windows command prompt using `C:` and the current directory.
- Where most of the executable commands are located?
- Syntax for viewing a particular variable.
- What does `PATH` variable do?
- View the directories of executatble programs currently stored
- How multiple directory paths are placed?
- Why might the shell return a `command not found` error even if the command exists on the system?
- Append the directory `/root/newhackingtool` to the current `PATH` variable to allow running its tools from any location
- Verify that the `/root/newhackingtool` directory has been successfully added to the `PATH`
- Why should you avoid adding too many directories to the `PATH` variable?
- Demonstrate the incorrect command to assign `/root/newhackingtool` to the `PATH` variable and explain why this leads to a "command not found" error for standard system commands
- What precaution should be taken before modifying the `PATH` variable to prevent accidental data loss?
- Create a user-defined variable named `MYNEWVARIABLE` containing the string `"Hacking is the most valuable skill set in the 21st century"`
- Display the value stored in the `MYNEWVARIABLE` variable
- Delete the `MYNEWVARIABLE` variable from the system
- Verify that `MYNEWVARIABLE` has been successfully deleted
- Again Create the `MYNEWVARIABLE` variable and this time make it permanent meaning surviving session close, startup.
- Delete the newly added variable
