- View all default environment variables on the system
- What is the naming convention for environment variables?
- View all environment variables, including shell variables, local variables, and shell functions
- View environment variables line by line using the `more` command
- Filter for a specific variable (e.g., `HISTSIZE`) within the environment list
- What does `HISTSIZE` define and what is the default value
- Change the value of `HISTSIZE` to disable command history storage for the current session
- Make the change to the `HISTSIZE` variable permanent so it persists outside the current shell session
- Save the current value of the `HISTSIZE` variable to a text file named `valueofHISTSIZE.txt` in the home directory
- Save the output of all current environment settings to a text file named `valueofALLon01012017.txt` in the home directory
- Reset the `HISTSIZE` variable to the value `1000` and make it permanent across all environments
- Set the shell prompt variable to the string `"World's Best Hacker: #"` and export it to make it permanent across sessions
- Configure the shell prompt to mimic a Windows command prompt using `C:` and the current directory placeholder `\w`
- What do the following placeholders represent when used in the `PS1` variable?
  - **\u** 
  - **\h** 
  - **\W** 
- View the directories currently stored in the `PATH` variable
- Why might the shell return a `command not found` error even if the command exists on the system?
- Append the directory `/root/newhackingtool` to the current `PATH` variable to allow running its tools from any location
- Verify that the `/root/newhackingtool` directory has been successfully added to the `PATH`
- Why should you avoid adding too many directories to the `PATH` variable?
- Demonstrate the incorrect command to assign `/root/newhackingtool` to the `PATH` variable and explain why this leads to a "command not found" error for standard system commands
- What precaution should be taken before modifying the `PATH` variable to prevent accidental data loss?
- Create a user-defined variable named `MYNEWVARIABLE` containing the string `"Hacking is the most valuable skill set in the 21st century"`
- Display the value stored in the `MYNEWVARIABLE` variable
- Delete the `MYNEWVARIABLE` variable from the system
- Verify that `MYNEWVARIABLE` has been successfully deleted
