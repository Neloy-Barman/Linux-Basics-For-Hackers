- What is a shell
  - **Shell:** An interface between the user and the operating system that allows for file manipulation and running commands immediately, bypassing GUI abstractions for better customization and control.

- What are common Linux Shells?
  - **Common Linux Shells:** Korn shell, Z shell, C shell, and Bourne-again shell (bash).

- Why is `bash` the preferred choice?
   - It is available on nearly all Linux and UNIX distributions (including macOS and Kali) and can run both system commands and its own built-in commands.

- What are the functions of the `echo` and `read` commands?
  - **echo:** Displays messages to the screen.
  - **read:** Reads in data and stores it elsewhere.
  
- What tools are required to create shell scripts?
  - A **text editor** is required to write scripts.
  - **Examples:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, `gedit`, `kate`, `Leafpad`.
  - **Note:** The choice of editor does not make a difference in the script's functionality.

- What is this combination `#!` called?
  - Shebang

- Create a simple Bash script that prints "Hello, Hackers-Arise!"
  ```bash
    #! /bin/bash
    # This is my first bash script. Wish me luck.
    echo "Hello, HackersArise!"
  ```
  - **Shebang (`#!`):** A combination of a hash mark and an exclamation mark followed by the path to the interpreter (e.g., `/bin/bash`). This tells the operating system to use the bash shell interpreter.
    - *Note:* This can be used to specify other interpreters as well, such as Perl or Python.
  - **Comments (`#`):** Lines starting with a hash mark are comments. They are visible only to humans and are ignored by the interpreter, allowing you to leave notes explaining the code.
  - **echo:** A command that repeats (echoes) the text following it back to the monitor. The message usually requires double quotation marks.

- How should you save the script file with name `HelloHackersArise`?
  - Save the file with the name and **no file extension**.

- Check the permissions of the script and identify the default state
  ```bash
    ls -l
  ```
  - **Problem:** By default, a newly created bash script is not executable, even by the owner.

- Grant execute permissions to the owner, group, and others
  ```bash
    chmod 755 HelloHackersArise
  ```
  - **Result:** The permissions change to `rwxr-xr-x`.
  - **Effect:** The script is now executable and ready to run.

- Run the script `HelloHackersArise`
  ```bash
    ./HelloHackersArise
  ```
  - **`./` Prefix:** Tells the system to execute the script specifically from the *current directory*.
  - **Purpose:** It ensures that if another file with the same name exists elsewhere in the system (e.g., in the system path), it is ignored. This is good practice to localize execution, especially for files with common names like `start` or `setup`.
  - **Output:** The script returns the message: `Hello, HackersArise!`

- Create a script that 
  - prompts the user for their 
    - name => `What is your name?`
    - chapter => `What chapter are you on in Linux Basics for Hackers?`
  - stores the input in variables
  - echoes a greeting => `Welcome OccupytheWeb to Chapter 8 of Linux Basics for Hackers!`
  ```bash
    #! /bin/bash
    # This script prompts for input and displays it using variables
    echo "What is your name?"
    read name
    echo "What chapter are you on in Linux Basics for Hackers?"
    read chapter
    echo "Welcome" $name "to Chapter" $chapter "of Linux Basics for Hackers!"
  ```
  - **Variables:** Storage locations in memory that hold changeable values, such as strings or numbers.
  - **`read` command:** Takes input from the keyboard and stores it in the specified variable (e.g., `read name`).
  - **`$` symbol:** To use or display the value contained in a variable, you must precede the variable name with `$` (e.g., `$name`).
  - **File Extension:** The convention for script files is `.sh` (e.g., `WelcomeScript.sh`). While not strictly required, it is standard practice.

- Define the different categories of hackers based on their intentions
  - **Black hat:** Hackers with malicious intentions, such as stealing data or defacing websites.
  - **White hat:** Hackers with good intentions, such as helping developers and administrators secure systems.
  - **Gray hat:** Hackers who tend to move between the malicious and benevolent extremes.

- Perform a standard TCP connect scan on a target IP (`192.168.181.1`) using `nmap`
  ```bash
    nmap -sT 192.168.181.1
  ```
  - **nmap:** A tool used to probe a system to check network connectivity and discover open ports (and thus running services).
  - **-sT:** The switch designated for a TCP connect scan, considered the simplest and most reliable scan type.

- Scan a specific port (`3306`) on a target IP using `nmap`
  ```bash
    nmap -sT 192.168.181.1 -p 3306
  ```
  - **-p:** The option used to specify the particular port you want to scan (e.g., `3306` for MySQL).

- Describe the vulnerability in the Aloha POS system exploited by Max Butler
  - **Vulnerability:** The Aloha Point of Sale (POS) system contained a built-in technical support backdoor.
  - **Mechanism:** Tech support could access the system through **port 5505** to assist clients.
  - **Exploit:** Max Butler wrote a script to scan millions of IP addresses for open port 5505. Systems with this port open were likely running the vulnerable POS software, allowing him to gain sysadmin privileges and steal credit card numbers.

- Write a Bash script(`MySQLscanner`) that performs the following steps:
  - Run an Nmap TCP Connect scan on the subnet `192.168.181.0/24`.
  - Target only the MySQL port `3306`.
  - Save the results in grepable format to a file named `MySQLscan`, while sending the standard output to the void (discarding it).
  - Read the MySQLscan file, filter for lines containing "open", and redirect them to a new file named MySQLscan2.
  - Display the contents of MySQLscan2.
  ```bash
    #! /bin/bash
    # This script is designed to find hosts with MySQL installed
    nmap -sT 192.168.181.0/24 -p 3306 >/dev/null -oG MySQLscan
    cat MySQLscan | grep open > MySQLscan2
    cat MySQLscan2
  ```

- Create an advanced scanner script that prompts the user for the IP range and port to scan
  - FirstIP => `Enter the starting IP address : 192.168.181.0`
  - LastOctetIP => `Enter the last octet of the last IP address : 192.168.181.255`
  - port => `Enter the port number you want to scan for : 3306`
  - Keep the other things as previous
  ```bash
    #! /bin/bash
    echo "Enter the starting IP address : "
    read FirstIP
    echo "Enter the last octet of the last IP address : "
    read LastOctetIP
    echo "Enter the port number you want to scan for : "
    read port
    nmap -sT $FirstIP-$LastOctetIP -p $port >/dev/null -oG MySQLscan
    cat MySQLscan | grep open > MySQLscan2
    cat MySQLscan2
  ```
  
- Run the `MySQLscannerAdvanced.sh` script and provide the necessary inputs
  ```bash
    ./MySQLscannerAdvanced.sh
  ```
