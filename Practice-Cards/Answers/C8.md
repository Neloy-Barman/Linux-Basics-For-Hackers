- What is a shell
  - **Shell:** An interface between the user and the operating system that allows for file manipulation and running commands immediately, bypassing GUI abstractions for better customization and control.

- What are common Linux Shells?
  - **Common Linux Shells:** Korn shell, Z shell, C shell, and Bourne-again shell (bash).

- Why is `bash` the preferred choice?
   - It is available on nearly all Linux and UNIX distributions (including macOS and Kali) and can run both system commands and its own built-in commands.

- What are the functions of the `echo` and `read` commands?
  - **echo:** Displays messages to the screen.
  - **read:** Reads in data and stores it elsewhere.
  
- What tools are required to create shell scripts?
  - A **text editor** is required to write scripts.
  - **Examples:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, `gedit`, `kate`, `Leafpad`.
  - **Note:** The choice of editor does not make a difference in the script's functionality.

- Create a simple Bash script that prints "Hello, Hackers-Arise!"
  ```bash
    #! /bin/bash
    # This is my first bash script. Wish me luck.
    echo "Hello, HackersArise!"
  ```
  - **Shebang (`#!`):** A combination of a hash mark and an exclamation mark followed by the path to the interpreter (e.g., `/bin/bash`). This tells the operating system to use the bash shell interpreter.
    - *Note:* This can be used to specify other interpreters as well, such as Perl or Python.
  - **Comments (`#`):** Lines starting with a hash mark are comments. They are visible only to humans and are ignored by the interpreter, allowing you to leave notes explaining the code.
  - **echo:** A command that repeats (echoes) the text following it back to the monitor. The message usually requires double quotation marks.

- How should you save the script file?
  - Save the file with a chosen name (e.g., `HelloHackersArise`) and **no file extension**.

- Check the permissions of the script and identify the default state
  ```bash
    ls -l
  ```
  - **Problem:** By default, a newly created bash script is not executable, even by the owner.

- Grant execute permissions to the owner, group, and others
  ```bash
    chmod 755 HelloHackersArise
  ```
  - **Result:** The permissions change to `rwxr-xr-x`.
  - **Effect:** The script is now executable and ready to run.

- Run the script `HelloHackersArise` from the current directory
  ```bash
    ./HelloHackersArise
  ```
  - **`./` Prefix:** Tells the system to execute the script specifically from the *current directory*.
  - **Purpose:** It ensures that if another file with the same name exists elsewhere in the system (e.g., in the system path), it is ignored. This is good practice to localize execution, especially for files with common names like `start` or `setup`.
  - **Output:** The script returns the message: `Hello, HackersArise!`

- Create a script that prompts the user for their name and chapter, stores the input in variables, and echoes a greeting
  ```bash
    #! /bin/bash
    # This script prompts for input and displays it using variables
    
    echo "What is your name?"
    read name
    echo "What chapter are you on in Linux Basics for Hackers?"
    read chapter
    echo "Welcome" $name "to Chapter" $chapter "of Linux Basics for Hackers!"
  ```
  - **Variables:** Storage locations in memory that hold changeable values, such as strings or numbers.
  - **`read` command:** Takes input from the keyboard and stores it in the specified variable (e.g., `read name`).
  - **`$` symbol:** To use or display the value contained in a variable, you must precede the variable name with `$` (e.g., `$name`).
  - **File Extension:** The convention for script files is `.sh` (e.g., `WelcomeScript.sh`). While not strictly required, it is standard practice.

- Define the different categories of hackers based on their intentions
  - **Black hat:** Hackers with malicious intentions, such as stealing data or defacing websites.
  - **White hat:** Hackers with good intentions, such as helping developers and administrators secure systems.
  - **Gray hat:** Hackers who tend to move between the malicious and benevolent extremes.

- Perform a standard TCP connect scan on a target IP (`192.168.181.1`) using `nmap`
  ```bash
    nmap -sT 192.168.181.1
  ```
  - **nmap:** A tool used to probe a system to check network connectivity and discover open ports (and thus running services).
  - **-sT:** The switch designated for a TCP connect scan, considered the simplest and most reliable scan type.

- Scan a specific port (`3306`) on a target IP using `nmap`
  ```bash
    nmap -sT 192.168.181.1 -p 3306
  ```
  - **-p:** The option used to specify the particular port you want to scan (e.g., `3306` for MySQL).

- Describe the vulnerability in the Aloha POS system exploited by Max Butler
  - **Vulnerability:** The Aloha Point of Sale (POS) system contained a built-in technical support backdoor.
  - **Mechanism:** Tech support could access the system through **port 5505** to assist clients.
  - **Exploit:** Max Butler wrote a script to scan millions of IP addresses for open port 5505. Systems with this port open were likely running the vulnerable POS software, allowing him to gain sysadmin privileges and steal credit card numbers.

- What is the objective of the "First Hacker Script" task?
  - The goal is to write a script similar to Max Butler's scanner but adapted for a different target.
  - **Target Service:** MySQL (an open-source database).
  - **Target Port:** **3306** (the default port for MySQL).
  - **Motivation:** Databases are valuable targets ("Golden Fleece") for hackers because they often contain personally identifiable information (PII) and credit card numbers.

- Create a script named `MySQLscanner.sh` to scan the subnet `192.168.181.0/24` for open MySQL ports (3306)
  ```bash
    #! /bin/bash
    # This script is designed to find hosts with MySQL installed
    nmap -sT 192.168.181.0/24 -p 3306 >/dev/null -oG MySQLscan
    cat MySQLscan | grep open > MySQLscan2
    cat MySQLscan2
  ```

- Explain the `nmap` switches and redirection operators used in the script
  - **-sT:** Performs a TCP connect scan.
  - **-p 3306:** Specifies the target port to scan (MySQL default).
  - **>/dev/null:** Redirects standard output to a special device file that discards all data, effectively hiding the output from the screen for a cleaner/stealthier run.
  - **-oG MySQLscan:** Saves the output to a file named `MySQLscan` in a "grepable" format, which is optimized for parsing by the `grep` utility.

- How does the script filter the results to show only open ports?
  ```bash
    cat MySQLscan | grep open > MySQLscan2
  ```
  - It reads the grepable output file (`MySQLscan`), pipes it to `grep` to filter for lines containing the keyword "open", and redirects those specific lines into a new file (`MySQLscan2`).

- Create an advanced scanner script that prompts the user for the IP range and port to scan
  ```bash
    #! /bin/bash
    echo "Enter the starting IP address : "
    read FirstIP
    echo "Enter the last octet of the last IP address : "
    read LastOctetIP
    echo "Enter the port number you want to scan for : "
    read port
    nmap -sT $FirstIP-$LastOctetIP -p $port >/dev/null -oG MySQLscan
    cat MySQLscan | grep open > MySQLscan2
    cat MySQLscan2
  ```

- How does the script handle the user input and execute the scan?
  - **Prompts:** Uses `echo` to ask the user for specific details (Starting IP, Last Octet, Port).
  - **Variable Storage:** Uses the `read` command to capture keyboard input and store it in variables (`FirstIP`, `LastOctetIP`, `port`).
  - **Nmap Execution:** Constructs the scan command dynamically using the stored variables:
    - **IP Range:** Concatenates `$FirstIP` and `$LastOctetIP` with a hyphen (e.g., `$FirstIP-$LastOctetIP`) to define the range.
    - **Port:** Uses `-p $port` to specify the target service.
  - **Output Management:** Redirects standard output to `/dev/null` to hide the raw scan data from the screen, while saving the "grepable" output (`-oG`) to a file for filtering.

- Run the `MySQLscannerAdvanced.sh` script and provide the necessary inputs
  ```bash
    ./MySQLscannerAdvanced.sh
  ```
  - **Inputs:**
    - **Starting IP address:** `192.168.181.0`
    - **Last IP address:** `192.168.181.255`
    - **Port number:** `3306`
  - **Output:** The script reports the IP addresses found with the specified port open (e.g., `Host: 192.168.181.254 ...`).

- Why is using variables in this script considered beneficial?
  - It allows the user to determine the IP address range and port to scan dynamically without needing to **edit the script** source code for every execution.
