- **Note:** _We will use `/etc/snort/snort.lua` as the file to execute commands._
- View file from the beginning
  ```bash
    head /etc/snort/snort.lua

  ```
- View file from the ending
  ```bash
    tail /etc/snort/snort.lua
  ```

  ```bash
    tail -20 /etc/snort/snort.lua
  ```
- Number Lines of the file
  ```bash
    nl /etc/snort/snort.lua

  ```bash
    cat /etc/snort/snort.lua | grep output
