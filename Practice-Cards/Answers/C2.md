1. Install `snort` by following directions from `https://www.kali.org/tools/snort/`
   ```bash
   sudo apt install snort
   ```
   1. If it raises issues, follow the directives from the CLI:
      ```bash
      sudo apt update
      ```
2. **Note:** We will use `/etc/snort/snort.lua` as the file to execute commands.
3. View the file from the beginning:
   ```bash
   head /etc/snort/snort.lua
   ```
4. View the first 20 lines of the file:
   ```bash
   head -20 /etc/snort/snort.lua
   ```
5. View the file from the end:
   ```bash
   tail /etc/snort/snort.lua
   ```
6. View the last 20 lines of the file:
   ```bash
   tail -20 /etc/snort/snort.lua
   ```
7. Number the lines of the file:
   ```bash
   nl /etc/snort/snort.lua
   ```
8. Find all the lines with the word `output`:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/snort/snort.lua | grep output
   ```
9. View the man page of any command:
   ```bash
   man tail
   ```
10. Hacker Challenge: Display the 5 lines immediately before the line: `-- payload_injector = { }`
    1. **Note:** Don't count the empty spaces as lines.
    2. 1st Approach:
       ```bash
       nl /etc/snort/snort.lua | grep payload
       tail -n+7 /etc/snort/snort.lua | head -n 5
       ```
    3. 2nd Approach:
11. Find and Replace:
    1. Replace the word `tcp` with `TCP`:
       1. Globally:
          ```bash
          sed s/tcp/TCP/g /etc/snort/snort.lua > snort2.lua
          ```
       2. 1st Occurrence:
          ```bash
          sed s/tcp/TCP/ /etc/snort/snort.lua > snort2.lua
          ```
       3. 2nd Occurrence:
          ```bash
          sed s/tcp/TCP/2 /etc/snort/snort.lua > snort2.lua
          ```
    2. Save the file `snort2.lua`.
    3. Remove `snort2.lua`:
       ```bash
       rm snort2.lua
       ```
12. View the file using the Page System:
    1. Normal:
       ```bash
       more /etc/snort/snort.lua
       ```
    2. Along with searching occurrences of a particular word:
       ```bash
       less /etc/snort/snort.lua
       ```
       1. Press the key and type `output` for search:
          ```bash
          /output
          ```
       2. Press the key to go to the next occurrence:
          ```bash
          n
          ```
